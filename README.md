I could not get this working on VM, so I just did it on my local machine. The reason why I couldn't, I believe, is because my VM is missing one of the flags necessary to run the mongod command. The exact steps I took are described here:

The problem I had is described here:

I tried doing it on my local machine, but mongodb isn't working properly. I don't know why. I'm at my mental limit so im done.
