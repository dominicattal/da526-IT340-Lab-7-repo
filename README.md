I could not get this working on VM, so I just did it on my local machine. The reason why I couldn't, I believe, is because my VM is missing one of the flags necessary to run the mongod command. The exact steps I took are described here:

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/?operating-system=linux&linux-distribution=ubuntu&linux-package=default&search-linux=with-search-linux

The problem I had is described here:

The assignment never explicitly stated that I had to use the VM.
